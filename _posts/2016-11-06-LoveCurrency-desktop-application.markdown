Once you download the source code from here, use `npm install` to install all the dependency packages.

then, use `npm start` to start the application.

## How to build
I have updated the build settings for Mac in package.json with build.

you have to use `npm run build-mac` to build the application in Mac. (Tested in MacOS Sierra. Version : 10.12.1)

There is possibility to create build for Windows using `npm run build-win`. But haven't tested.
