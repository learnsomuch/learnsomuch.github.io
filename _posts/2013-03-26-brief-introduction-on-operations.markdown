There are various types of Operations* involved in IT industry. Here are few among those categories:

## CoreOps:

This is the basic and most crucial Ops team until CloudOps was formed. CoreOps involves in various activities which includes system restarts, monitoring, deployment and log analysis. This team’s runs 24×7 and supporting for systems to run without issues.

## CloudOps:

CloudOps was termed recently which is almost replaced instead of CoreOps. CloudOps will have an exposure of various products and variety of servers. Below are the different items CloudOps is involved in:

* Have an idea and knowledge on Architecture of a product(s).
* Knows about the software components installed or used in each server(s).
* Have all the list of server details includes OS information and their hardware configurations.
  (VM share resource details, Network details include firewall rules)
* Deployment details and those updated code files with passwords.
* Information on maintenance, future fixes and software bugs collection.
* Backup and recovery details include critical DB credentials, backed up files and storage details.
* Have an idea on monitoring tools involved internally (within corp) and externally (outside corp).

## DevOps:

DevOps is a common term used while coordinating tasks between development colleagues and operation colleagues. They involved and have knowledge on below items:

* Minor development activities involved (Scripting, small patch development).
* Have complete knowledge on Application stuff.
* Exposure on development landscape details and the tools used while development.
* Backup and recovery improvement script modifications.
* Monitoring support to CloudOps or CoreOps.

## ResearchOps:

This is the most recent identified Ops team in IT Industry. This team should have patience, interest and curious to learn new things and should have analysis capabilities.

* Analysis and exploring on what processes running in a server while application is UP or DOWN.
* Reading graphs and predicting next values.
* Understand and analyze use cases of Memory, CPU and logs.

I strongly recommend you to prefer working on ResearchOps activities eventhough you are in CoreOps or DevOps.

## Opportunities@Ops:

Categorized in to three:

1. Success@Ops:

	* Will have tremendous knowledge on different activities involved and learn more about setting up a product and their installed components.
    * Security analysis of a product is most exposed to Ops than Development.
    * Strikes great ideas!! [while working on new products – companies so called innovative products ]

2. Failure@Ops:

    * You may not have development role and will not get a chance to work new things everytime.
    * You will be ending up with repetitive work and excel work.

3. Future@Ops:

    * Administrator opportunities and will have interest in solving and simplifying operations work.
    * Likely to be interested and get opportunities in automation teams. But will not have chance to work anymore in development.

## Suggestions@Ops:

Please do not treat these as standard rules which are applicable everytime. This could be only my point of view / my perspective:

* Do not just work on excels. Make sure you are learning something even from that. It may have very critical or important information. Going through that content will not harm you anyway.
* Just do not stick with clicks on some button which you really don’t know what is happening. Keep exploring on what is going on in background.
* Blind document following will not help you or your career. Research on every topic and make sure you understood procedure and concepts involved.
