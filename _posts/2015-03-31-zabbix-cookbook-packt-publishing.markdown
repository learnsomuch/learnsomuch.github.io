### Who needs this book ?

If you have some experience with Zabbix and wish to take your infrastructure to the next level, then this book is for you. Before you start with Zabbix, or monitoring in general, it is best to have some basic Linux knowledge and a good understanding of snmp, virtualization, and scripting.

### What will you learn ?

### In Detail:

This book will teach you the skills required to successfully set up and configure a Zabbix server. We will guide you through the interface setup and explain all the features available in Zabbix.

You will begin with learning the Zabbix installation and configuration steps in detail, and then move on to exploring its interface and architecture. You will then work with groups, users, and permissions. The book will then take you through monitoring and testing with Zabbix. Followed by this, you will gain insights into using templates, and also create impressive graphs and maps for data visualization and reporting. Towards the end of the book, you will learn how to maintain, upgrade, and troubleshoot your Zabbix infrastructure.


### About author - Patrik Uytterhoeven

Patrik Uytterhoeven has over 16 years of experience in IT. Most of this time was spent on HP Unix and Red Hat Linux. In late 2012, he joined Open-Future, a leading open source integrator and the first Zabbix reseller and training partner in Belgium.

When Patrik joined Open-Future, he gained the opportunity to certify himself as a Zabbix Certified Trainer. Since then, he has provided trainings and public demonstrations not only in Belgium but also around the world, in countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Canada, and Ireland.

Because Patrik also has a deep interest in configuration management, he wrote some Ansible roles for Red Hat 6.x and 7.x to deploy and update Zabbix. These roles, and some others, can be found in the Ansible Galaxy at https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/users/1375.

Patrik is also a technical reviewer of Learning Ansible and the upcoming book, Ansible Configuration Management, both published by Packt Publishing.
