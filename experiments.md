_I have done lots of experiments related to computers, Web and Programming!_

However, I would like to share a few :

* [CVtwink - Automatic Real-time Resume Generator](http://learnsomuch.com/cvtwink/v2/index.html#/)
Haven't completed the code yet, Will host code soon in [Github Account](https://github.com/learnsomuch).
* [AllRounder - Script to gather information quickly in linux](https://github.com/learnsomuch/AllRounder)
An executable script in linux to fetch details of server, user, disk, processes, CPU, memory and network together.

Note: I prefered to write Experiments instead of so called Projects.Other Experiments as of now are not so interesting, so skipped!
